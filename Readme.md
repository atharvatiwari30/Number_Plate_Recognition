# Number Plate Recognition Model

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a number plate recognition system using deep learning techniques. The system can detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images or video frames.

## Features

- **Number Plate Detection**: Uses object detection to locate number plates in images.
- **Character Recognition**: Recognizes the characters on the detected number plates.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves high accuracy in various lighting conditions and different plate formats.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Flask (for the web application)
- Tesseract-OCR (for character recognition)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-plate-recognition.git
   cd number-plate-recognition
